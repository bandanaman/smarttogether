TRIP is organising its fifth one-day stakeholder workshop, which will take place in Brussels on Wednesday 3 May 2017, and cover the subject of cleaner transport.

The TRIP team will share preliminary results from their ongoing review of cleaner transport and discuss and validate their conclusions with delegates.

Participants will learn about the progress in cleaner transport research and how the results can be used to guide the development of future clean transport. They will also have the opportunity to influence recommendations for future policy development.
