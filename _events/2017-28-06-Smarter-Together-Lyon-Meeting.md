The Smarter Together WP2, WP7 and Core Group meeting will take place from 28 to 30 June 2017, and will include a visit of the follower cities in Lyon (WP7), Peer-to-peer exchanges (WP2), and a Core Group session. Additionally, there will be 5 workshops on each of the following Smarter Together areas of focus: data platform, citizen engagement, district heating & renewables, refurbishment, and e-mobility. For each workshop, there will be 45 minutes of presentation by the three lighthouse cities (15 minutes for each lighthouse city). To be discussed are actions planned, difficulties encountered and solutions implemented. Peer-to-peer exchanges (WP2 + WP7) will follow.
