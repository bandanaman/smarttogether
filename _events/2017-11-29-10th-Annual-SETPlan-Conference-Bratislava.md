2017 is the tenth anniversary of the [SET Plan](https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/technology-and-innovation/strategic-energy-technology-plan){:target="_blank"}, the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan that aims to accelerate the development and deployment of low-carbon technologies. This conference will review the progress achieved over the past decade in the transition to a low carbon, innovative energy future and the SET Plan's key role as the technology pillar of EU's energy research and innovation policy.  It will focus on:

- the implementation process of the Energy Union strategy, with a special focus on its Research and Innovation dimension and the current state of negotiations under the 'Clean Energy for All Europeans' package
- the role of innovative low-carbon technologies in boosting European competitiveness, progress in developing new technologies and smart energy systems for efficient use of energy, and the growing share of renewables in the primary energy consumption of EU member states
- current trends in electro-mobility, the safe use of nuclear energy, enhanced energy storage, and other crucial technologies for the transformation of the EU energy system
- the role of Central European countries and their contribution in implementing the Energy Union's and the SET Plan's goals.

10 main panels will cover the priorities of the Energy Union and the SET Plan and three parallel thematic evening sessions will focus on related subjects. Side events will also be held the day before.

The SET Plan Conference is held under the auspices of the Estonian Presidency of the Council of the EU. It will be opened by European Commission Vice-President for Energy Union Maroš Šefčovič and bring together researchers and policy-makers from EU countries, particularly Central Europe, in addition to stakeholders and representatives from business, international organizations, science and innovation, civil society and regional and local government research organizations. It will run in conjunction with the 11th annual Central European Energy Conference (CEEC).
