title: Santiago de Compostela
subtitle: "Santiago de Compostela, 100 000 inhabitants and capital of Galicia, is a UNESCO World Heritage City, pilgrimage destination, European capital of culture and example of historical, urban and environmental regeneration, attracting thousands of visitors. Since 2012, the City Council of Santiago de Compostela has been working on SMARTiAGO initiative, a strategy to address the smart city challenges, involving different agents of the local, regional and national innovation ecosystem. Its main objective is the implementation of a Smart City Roadmap aimed at placing Santiago de Compostela as reference point on how to address smart city challenges in heritage cities. Due to special requirements as heritage city, the city council has proposed a roadmap based on non-intrusive solutions as a starting point for all smart city deployments to be implemented."
