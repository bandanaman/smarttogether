subtitle: "Lyon's demonstration area is Lyon Confluence - one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in France (150 ha – 600 000 m2 existing floor area – 1.000.000 m2 of new buildings). It is the first WWF approved urban development in France and it is the largest urban redevelopment area in France with such an ambitious target such as the zero carbon objectives: the annual greenhouse gases emissions at the end of the urban project must not be superior to the level of emission at the project start."
