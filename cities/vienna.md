*   refurbish three residential neighborhoods with 1,300 inhabitants and a total floor surface of 75,000 m2
*   ensure savings of 6000000 kilowatt hours (kWh)  per year in all refurbished housing complexes together. This corresponds to the energy use of about 700 housing units
*   guarantee more sustainable and future-oriented energy supply with 9,000,000 kWh provided by renewable energy sources (thermic as well as electric energy), which will result in considerable savings for the tenants in energy and heating costs.
*   save about 550 tons of CO2
*   secure and/or create 900 
*   promote an intensive governance learning process by involving eight departments of the City of Vienna’s administration, ensuring that the experiences and results of the project will be integrated in a sustainable way all over the city

<h2><span class="ornament">CREATE TOGETHER:</span></h2> Focus Participation

The inhabitants of the project area have the opportunity to participate in different ways and on different levels in the development of their smart district:

*   e-cars for housing communities
*   zero-energy-gym showcase in the secondary school NMS Enkplatz

<h2><span class="ornament">SUPPLYING TOGETHER:</span></h2> Focus Energy

Climate-friendly energy systems will be developed and implemented with the aim of contributing to the UN and smart city climate goals:

*   waste heat recovery and use of solar heat (transformation of solar energy into heat) for 3,000 households
*   further development of district heating through use of local renewable energy sources
*   100,000 kWh per year produced by photovoltaic installations (transformation of solar energy into electricity)
*   district heat connection to 250 flats
*   accompanying monitoring and optimization of energy systems
