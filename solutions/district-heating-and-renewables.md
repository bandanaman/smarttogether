Cites consume 80% of global energy supply and release more than 70% of global CO2 emissions. As the urban population is expected to increase from 50% to 75% of the worldâ€™s population within the next decades, cities are facing huge challenges to meet the growing demand for reliable, clean and secure energy. Conversely, they represent a great opportunity for tackling global warming.

Our goal is to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emission related to energy supply in cities, improving the efficiency of existing energy networks and increasing the use of local energy sources.

The three lighthouse cities have a similar approach to maximize the use of local energy resources, including renewable heat and power. The demonstration activities include:

* **New generation district heating systems with connected heat substations**, partially powered with renewable heat produced by photovoltaic systems, geothermal energy, wood-fired cogeneration power plant or recovered industrial waste heat
* **Smart photovoltaic systems** equipped with power regulation features and micro-storage capacity lowering the impacts onto the local distribution grid
* **Battery storage capacity**connected to a virtual power plant to maximize the efficiency of renewable power generation in the demonstration district
