On 9 November 2017, the SIMmobile, the mobile information and communication lab of Smarter Together, held a special information day at the major Siemens factory in Leberstraße in the project area in Simmering. Siemens, with 1.200 staff, is a major employer and is active in key areas of smart city innovation, namely smart mobility. The creativity and motivation of its staff is hence not only highly important to the enterprise, but also as a multiplier for Smart City and Smarter Together issues. The Urban Renewal Office GB* 3/11, that is implementing all SIMmobile activities, made an informal survey for the occasion of the visit. This servey may prove to be relevant not only to Siemens but through analysis, also for strategic dialogue on the European level.

Siemens Leberstraße has already proactively initiated and implemented a series of Smarter Together activities such as E-Forklifts that are running since last winter and an e-car that is being used for the internal post transfer. Employees were given a charging station for e-bikes, and currently, an innovative logistic center is being installed in the context of innovative approaches supported by Smarter Together. The innovation does not stop there, as more activities are planned in the coming years as well.
