On 19 October, SPL Lyon Confluence welcomed its national, European and international partners from the projects Lyon Smart Community (a French-Japanese partnership funded by NEDO), Next Buildings (FP7) and Smarter Together (Horizon 2020). The objective of this workshop, which took place during the same week as the final events for Lyon Smart Community and Next Buildings, was to not only present an overview of the Hikari project, but also to discuss future prospects through key topics: energy performance of buildings (new and refurbished), urban data platform, electric mobility.

Hikari is the first mix-use positive energy block built in the Lyon Metropolis area, meaning it produces more energy than it consumes during the year, thanks to photovoltaic panels (on the rooftop but also on the facade) and cogenerated production of heat and power from rapeseed oil.

The Hikari block is composed of 3 buildings for an overall surface of 12,000 m2, and features housing, office space, and shops. This block was built thanks to Japanese and European funding, and was commissioned in September 2015.
