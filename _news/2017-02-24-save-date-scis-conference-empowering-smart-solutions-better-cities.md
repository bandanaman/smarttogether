The conference '**Empowering smart solutions for better cities**', organised by the Smart Cities Information System, will take place on **2 and 3 October 2017 in Budapest, Hungary**. A mix of classic sessions and interactive methods, this event will bring  together key stakeholders from cities and regions, smart cities & energy efficiency projects, industry, business, European Commission and smart cities initiatives.

With the aim of encouraging the replication of smart cities technologies, solutions and experiences among cities and communities, the event will empower  participants to:

* provide insight into the European policy objectives and **drivers for innovation and replication** in the field of smart cities
* identify **essential factors of success and priorities for the market uptake** of innovative solutions by sharing stories of good replication experiences in small groups 
* present concrete achievements and best practices preselected with open call among **EU-funded and other demonstration projects** in several tracks: technology, finance, society, communication, and governance.
* find **solutions to specific replication challenges (or opportunities)** they are facing in their own city, with the help of the collective intelligence of the participants in interactive sessions.
