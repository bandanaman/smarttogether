The Munich Department of Urban Planning is a regular cooperation partner of the Smart City team of Munich. The Department has now invited the public and experts to an interesting students' exhibition presenting visions and concepts for future cities. What will construction and living be like in 2080? What will daily life look like in Munich? Students of the Technical University of Munich let visitors glimpse some well-founded possibilities for urban life in the near future.

Interdisciplinary Master's program students have teamed up for this project related to energy efficient and sustainable construction. They developed future oriented concepts for new housing and the restructuring of an actual municipal settlement. As a first step, they looked at fundamental visions, from there the students picked out aspects like mobility, lifestyle, housing requirements, building typology and climate effects. This resulted in concepts for future urban development and construction.

The students have been recognized at the renowned trade fair BAU 2017 for their ideas. The Munich Department of Department of Urban Planning is hosting the free exhibition from April to July 2017.
