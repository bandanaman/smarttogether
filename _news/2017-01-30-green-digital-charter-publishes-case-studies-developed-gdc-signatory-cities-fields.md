[Green Digital Charter](http://www.greendigitalcharter.eu/){:target="_blank"} published a catalogue with case studies and projects at the inception phase prepared by the GDC signatories within the framework of their ICT for energy efficiency-related commitments. The case studies are implemented actions associated with green digital development, while the projectâ€™ include planned actions in key policy domains.

The studies are presented in the following categories:

* Cross-domain: green digital activities that cut across two or more application areas
* Buildings: measures taken in municipal buildings and facilities, tertiary (non-municipal) buildings and facilities as well as residential buildings
* Energy: measures relating to energy and electricity production and distribution
* Transport: soft (non-motorised) modes, public and motorised private transportation, mobility management, and logistics and freight
* E-participation: green digital activities supporting citizen engagement by making city decisions accessible in open data format and by developing tools for mapping locations of environmental or social value
* Each city profile includes relevant web links and contact information to help you plan and organise your own study tour.
