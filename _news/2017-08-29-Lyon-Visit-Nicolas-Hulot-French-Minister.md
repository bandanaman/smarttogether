On 26 June 2017, Nicolas Hulot, the French Minister of Ecological and Solidary Transition, visited the Lyon-Confluence area to see the implementation of many features of sustainable development projects.

Some of these projects explored are being developed within the Smarter Together framework, such as various eco-refurbishment works in progress across Lyon-Confluence. These works span from social housing such as Cité Mignot, a social housing block of 160 housing units and 9,000 m2 owned by the social housing operator Régionale d’HLM de Lyon, to owner-group managed buildings undergoing renovation. 

Additional projects include, for example, the development of photovoltaic production and district heating systems, various electric charging stations such as the CNR electric car charging stations and Bluely electric car sharing system and chargers, as well as the Navly electric autonomous shuttle developed by NAVYA.
