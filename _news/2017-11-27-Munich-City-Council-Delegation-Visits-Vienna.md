At the end of October, a Munich delegation visited Vienna for discussions about European and international topics. The gathering explored the issue of how the City of Vienna and its municipal departments position themselves in European and international arenas, but also paid an official visit to the United Nations (UN) and stopping by Aspern, Vienna's ‘lake city’. The Viennese – much like the people of Munich – love a visit to the market, the agenda also made room for a focused discussion of this topic. The Munich delegation naturally visited the highlights of the local Smarter Together project in Simmering, too.
