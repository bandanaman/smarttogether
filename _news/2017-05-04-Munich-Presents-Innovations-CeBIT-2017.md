Smarter Together team members from Munich attended the world's leading digital trade fair CeBIT in Hannover in March. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, opened CeBIT 2017, held from March 20-24. The German cities of Cologne, Munich and Hamburg presented their innovations at a joint stand of ‘Smart City Forum’.

These three German cities had successfully applied for HORIZON 2020, the EU Framework Program for Research and Innovation funding projects such as Smarter Together. At CeBIT, Smarter Together (Munich, Lyon, and Vienna) presented next to Grow Smarter (Cologne, Barcelona, and Stockholm) and mySMARTLife (Hamburg, Helsinki, and Nantes).

The German experts introduced some early results of the Smarter Together project and the measures they are developing in the fields of energy, mobility, IT technology and participation – all addressing the smart city of the future. Digitalisation is a key factor of success for all city applications and crucial for meeting the challenges ahead for modern communities.

The Munich team showcased their street lamps with smart lighting sensors, solutions for providing public wireless connections and adaptive illumination technologies. Together with team members from reTHINK – a project also funded by HORIZON 2020 – they presented the prototype of a mobile app for organising and supporting municipal communities.

CeBIT visitors and experts showed great interest in smart city topics. The international members of different EU projects were delighted to connect and exchange experiences. Additionally, CeBIT provided valuable opportunities to network with visitors from politics, industry and other administrations.
