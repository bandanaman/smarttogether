On 19 October, Smarter Together project members were able to participate in the events surrounding the culmination of two projects in which the city of Lyon has also been involved in:  [Lyon Smart Community](https://www.grandlyon.com/projets/lyon-smart-community-confluence.html){:target="_blank"} and [FP7-Next Building.](http://www.next-buildings.eu/){:target="_blank"} Smarter Together has been able to closely exchange with these two projects in the past, engaging in knowledge sharing and exchange of solutions, and this meeting was a valuable opportunity to build on this collaboration.

Lyon Smart Community is a project created a Japanese-French partnership funded by NIDO (the Japanese governmental agency in charge of industry and technologies) focusing on the areas of positive energy buildings, a visualization tool for data consumption, and a prototype data platform for the Lyon-Confluence area. Concretely, this project contributed to 4 main outcomes in Lyon: 
-	The construction of the first mix-use positive energy plot in Lyon-Confluence, names “Hikari .”
-	An electric car-sharing system, powered by the local photovoltaic production in the neighbourhood.
-	A tool to help tenants of a social housing block to visualise their individual consumption of energy within their housing. The social housing block is currently in the process of eco-refurbishment and will end within the Smarter Together project.
-	A prototype of data platform to gather and analyse energy production and consumption of the Lyon-Confluence area, as well as mobility data.

FP7-Next Buildings, along with partners from Amsterdam and Helsingborg helped bring about the first mix-use positive energy plot in Lyon-Confluence, aiding in the development of the Hikari building, along with the Lyon Smart Community project.

These two projects served as important building blocks for the Smarter Together project in Lyon, providing the basis for several initiatives that are being developed upon with Smarter Together, namely in the areas of eco-refurbishment, data platform development, electric mobility, local energy production, and smart buildings.

The opportunity to meet amongst stakeholders and exchange on the basis of these mutually relevant topics was very valuable for Smarter Together partners, and although the Next Buildings and Lyon Smart Community projects are coming to an end, the opportunity to continue to collaborate across city and country borders will continue to exist through the Club of Cities, a Smarter Together initiative to collaborate and share knowledge on challenges and solutions even beyond the cities involved in the project itself.
