High level city representatives will debate the transformation of European cities, while smart cities projects will showcase innovative solutions and discuss crucial steps on the path to a smarter city.  

This smart cities conference, organised by the [Smart Cities Information System (SCIS)](http://www.smartcities-infosystem.eu/){:target="_blank"} and the European Commission, is seeking to encourage the replication of technological solutions, good practices and lesson learning among cities and businesses.
