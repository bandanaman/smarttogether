The 2-days workshop was a big opportunity for these cities to discuss common problems and find joint solutions for mobility and citizen engagement. A number of smart city critical topics were discussed:
- How to have a political and citizen buy-in for smart city projects
- How to identify the right stakeholders benefiting from the specific project and how to work with them; how to tailor the solutions for the specific local reality and ecosystem

Moreover, the planning and usage of data was also addressed as a smart city critical topic, in which synergies can be created between these cities.

*Each city is unique: and we cannot pretend to be like the others. Burgas does not want to be Copenhagen for cycling, nor Shanghai for modal split.* 
- Ruska Boyadzhieva, Deputy Mayor of Burgas
