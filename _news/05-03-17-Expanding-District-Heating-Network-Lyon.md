</div>

Most of the works for the district heating network in Lyon-Confluence area are finished and seven buildings are now connected to district heating. The installation of communication infrastructure in the substations of the district are in progress, in order to be able to collect data about energy consumption.

Additional buildings are expected to be connected to the district heating system in the coming months and years. For the moment, the district heating system runs with a provisional gas-based solution for energy production. The definitive source of production will increase the proportion of biomass in the energy mix. A decision of the Lyon Metropolis regarding the technical solution for the definitive source of energy production for the district heating is expected in the course of 2017.
