On Thursday, 12 October, Smarter Together joined fellow H2020-funded Lighthouse projects, industry partners, public and private sector representatives, and other stakeholders at the [EIP-SCC](https://eu-smartcities.eu/){:target="_blank"} General Assembly held in Brussels. This conference was of high relevance to Smarter Together as it was an important opportunity to join like-minded projects and partners in sharing progress, ideas, and strategies for moving forward in transforming cities to be more livable, innovative, and sustainable.

Starting with a Marketplace breakfast which featured roundtable discussions on topics ranging from citizen participation to [EU-China partnerships](http://eu-chinasmartcities.eu/){:target="_blank"}, the goal of this focused start to the day was on collaborating in order to help spark new solutions, partnerships, and ways of thinking.

A welcome address by moderator Paul Timmens was accompanied by a speech by Jacques Vermeulen of [Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/en_int){:target="_blank"} who urged the audience to think not only about their respective projects, but rather about about interconnecting Europe, setting the stage for the topic of shaping the smart cities of the future.

Connecting these messages to policy goals was a video message by Commission Vice President Maros Šefčovič, in which the importance of scale-up and synergies were stressed. Markku Markkula, First Vice President of the European Committee of the Regions, then followed and highlighted the need of an innovative, service-oriented economy, also stating that “European partnerships are key networking instruments and render the city innovation hubs competitive on global scale."

These thought provoking ideas led to a panel discussion on seeding the ground for market deployment of SCC solutions – from pilot to business cases. Panel moderator Pirita Lindholm, Director at [ERRIN](http://www.errin.eu/){:target="_blank"}, led a lively conversation with Markku Markkula; Ruska Boyadzhieva, Deputy Mayor of Burgas Municipality, Bulgaria; Jaroslav Kacer, Deputy Mayor of Brno; Jan Schoenig, Manager of Corporate Development, Special Projects at [Siemens AG](https://www.siemens.com/global/en/home.html){:target="_blank"}; and Francisco Rodriguez, Chairperson of the Collaboration group for H2020 funded projects on Smart and Sustainable Cities.

Next, Lora Borissova shared her hopes for the future of smart city development, and stressed the need for innovative financial resources. Following a networking lunch, Violeta Bulc, the European Commissioner for Transport, gave an inspiring speech touching upon the opportunities and importance in investing in smart, cooperative, and sustainable urban mobility solutions.

A panel discussion following these same themes was moderated by Stephanie Trpokov, Strategic Competitiveness Consultant with the [World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/){:target="_blank"}, and included Violeta Bulc along with John Jorritsma, Mayor of Eindhoven; Eva Witt, Director of Federal and European Affairs at [KfW](https://www.kfw.de/kfw.de-2.html){:target="_blank"}; Paolo Grossi, Executive vice President of [ENI](https://www.eni.com/en_IT/home.page){:target="_blank"}; Marcello Segatom CEO of [Zehus](http://www.zehus.it/){:target="_blank"}; and Peter Coveliers, member of the Board of Directors at the [European Energy Efficiency Fund.](https://www.eeef.eu/home.html){:target="_blank"}

These topics relating to e-mobility were of especially high relevance to the Smart Together project, as e-mobility is one of the main focus areas of the project. Advancements are being made in this field across the three lighthouse cities of Lyon, Munich, and Vienna and infrastructure, economic viability, and sustainability are some of the key considerations in implementation that were brought up in the panels.

Further, the scope of the EIP-SCC was widened by inviting speakers with international backgrounds to share their experiences – Daniel Annenberg, Innovation Secretary from Sao Paolo spoke about streamlining government processes and providing citizens with smart services, and Jo Arne Lindstad, Global Director of Smart Sustainable Cities at [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en){:target="_blank"} reminded attendees that the smart city is not only about the technology, but also depends on cooperation among diverse groups to achieve a common goal.

To close a challenging yet motivating day full of the exchange of ideas, Khalil Rouhana, Deputy Director-General for Communications Network, Content, and Technology urged listeners to find synergies and recognize the importance of transformation of data in doing so. Doncho Barbalov reminded us that smart cities should evolve according to citizen demands and that accordingly, we are smart people – so we should be living in smart cities. 

These and the many other lessons of the day are what the Smarter Together project seeks to embody in its mission to develop and implement smart and inclusive solutions to provide a better life in urban districts, and the EIP-SCC General Assembly was a useful reminder of these core principles, and brought together a community working relentlessly to achieve them.
