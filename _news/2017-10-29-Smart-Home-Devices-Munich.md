At the end of October, Smarter Together Munich organised a full-day promotional campaign offering smart home devices for all in Neuaubing-Westkreuz, the Munich district hosting the project. Local residents were invited to stop by the urban living lab and pick up their starter package. The set of measuring devices and an accompanying app will let participants manage the temperature and humidity in their homes, thereby allowing them to save on energy costs.

This free basic Smarter Together package is the first step toward encouraging local residents to ‘upgrade their home to a smart home’. The package includes two room sensors and a small base station, as well as personal access to a smartphone app. The app makes it easy to identify cause-and-effect relationships in individual ventilation and heating patterns and compare these with average data for other participants. The long-term aim is for the basic Smarter Together package to help reduce energy costs in the project area, and the package is a fun way to encourage users to become more energy-aware. By request, local residents can also receive additional security and convenience packages as an addition to the basic set.
