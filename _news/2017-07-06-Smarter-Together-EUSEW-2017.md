Smarter Together participated in the 2017 EU Sustainable Energy week throughout several different sessions and venues for a few days of exchange, learning, and collaboration with projects and professionals across a diverse range of industries and expertise.

On Tuesday 21 June, Smarter Together participated in the SCIS policy session “Sharing smart solutions and experiences: scale-up and replication in European cities,” with two different speakers representing the project. Emmanuel Gastaud from the city of Lyon explained the city’s smart data platform and its potential in replication, while Bojan Schnabl from the city of Vienna discussed the project’s Club of Cities initiative and the importance of knowledge sharing in fostering successful replication of ideas and solutions.

Also on 21 June, the SCC1 hosted a joint networking stand for all 9 Horizon 2020 Lighthouse projects, sharing information about the collaboration across projects and cities, as well as showcasing the interactive multi-touch screen with a geographic visualization of project locations and information on focus areas and solutions for each participating city.

On Thursday 22 June, Smarter Together organized its own networking stand, providing more detailed project information on the structure and progress of the project as well as the demonstration areas and solutions of Lighthouse cities Lyon, Munich, and Vienna. Visitors could interact, view visualizations of the project areas in poster format, browse the website, read more in brochures and postcards, and even pick up a foldable and recyclable water bottle to use on their next e-mobility trip and remember the Smarter Together project.

Finally, in the afternoon of 22 June, the SCC1 projects once again came together for a policy session titled “Lessons from the SCC1 smart city projects on grids, storage, and prosumer models.” Bojan Schnabl represented Smarter Together on the panel, bringing to light the importance of human aspect and citizen engagement while innovating and implementing solutions in the areas of energy and technology.
