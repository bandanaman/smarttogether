On April 20, the housing provider of the major refurbishment site Hauffgasse 37-47 invited tenants to present concrete activities for the upcoming start of the refurbishment construction work. Some 200 tenants of the 485 flats were present in the hall of the Community College (a Smarter Together partner) and received information on the next steps, the construction sites, the construction calendar, plus details regarding elevators, balconies and the new heating system. Smarter Together was also present as an additional EUR 1 million funding from the EU for innovative pilot activities related to heating systems and e-mobility, was announced. The overall feedback was very positive, and before the start of construction works in May, an additional tenant information session will be organized for the concerned units.
