On 21 November 2017, the closing ceremony of Beat the Street in Simmering confirmed its overwhelming success and positive spirit. More than 6.000 participants, mostly school children but also their parents and relatives from 11 local schools and 2 youth centers participated in the inclusive and integrative mobility challenge. This challenge promoted not only the values of healthy living, but also thanks to Smarter Together, the values of an inclusive smart city of the future with active citizens. Over 80.000 steps (twice the circumference of the Earth), had been recorded – and that even despite the autumn weather and early evenings due to winter time!

The feedback was largely positive and enthusiastic from teachers and students alike, who asked either to continue immediately, or at least to reiterate the game next year.

Julia Girardi-Hoog, the Vienna project manager of Smarter Together, underlined in her statement that “Beat the Street was conducted in a ludic way on the district level, which is what makes it so meaningful. Through Beat the Street, school children experience how they can use sustainable mobility to contribute to the city of the future - this is precisely the goal of Smarter Together as well.”
