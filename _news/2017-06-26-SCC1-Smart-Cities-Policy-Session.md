Cities represent three quarters of energy consumption and 80% of CO2 emissions worldwide, and with urbanisation expected to continue, a growing number of ‘Lighthouse’ cities across Europe have taken up the challenge of testing new ‘smart’ energy-saving solutions in large-scale test-beds under the impulse of European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. 

This year’s European Energy Sustainable Week brought together the nine smart city ‘Lighthouse’ projects in a special policy session entitled “Smarter is cleaner” to exchange on the environmental, financial and societal benefits of smart solutions.

Representatives from 13 cities involved in these smart city projects presented new energy products, discussed environmental policies and shared a catalogue of learning on how to grow a new market of smarter, more sustainable energy solutions and create a new generation of jobs. Introducing the “Smarter is cleaner” policy session, Jens Bartholmes, DG Energy Policy officer, reaffirmed the Commission’s support to the Lighthouse cities and satisfaction at the replication of the smart solutions plan in other cities who follow these projects. 

Smarter Together is one of the nine Smart city projects.

Bojan Schnabl representing Smarter Together from lighthouse city Vienna, Austria, participated on the panel of the policy session, touching on the importance of bringing a human aspect to energy and technology in the form of citizen engagement.

Smart city projects are part of a growing trend, redefining our urban environment and how we manage our use of resources. 

Working hand-in-hand with industrial partners, 27 lighthouse cities and 30 follower cities are paving the way for a new energy ecosystem collectively create low-carbon and resource-efficient economy.  

All nine smart city projects on show at the European Sustainable Energy Week are funded through the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation funding programme.
