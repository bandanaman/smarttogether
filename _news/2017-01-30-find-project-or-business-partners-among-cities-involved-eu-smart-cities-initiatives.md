We have [created two documents](http://www.smartcities-infosystem.eu/library/useful-resources){:target="_blank"} listing the cities participating in six European initiatives, the country and number of residents and the level of their involvement:

* CONCERTO and Smart cities calls in FP7 and Horizon 2020: lighthouse and follower cities, as well as details of their participation (210 cities)
* EIP-SCC Market place: number of commitments (299 cities)
* Covenant of Mayors: status (6882 cities)
* CIVITAS: number of projects (50 cities)
* Green Digital Charter: signatory status (50 cities)
* European Energy Award: status (1385 cities)
* The lists have filter functions which enable the user to find easily the cities satisfying these criteria. They can be a useful tool for cities, SMEs, industry, research establishment and academia to find project or business partners.
