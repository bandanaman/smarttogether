From 17-19 October, project partners gathered in Lyon for the Smarter Together progress review with the European Commission and [INEA.](https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/){:target="_blank"} All aspects of the project were discussed, including the Lighthouse cities’ project areas, replication, Follower cities and the Club of Cities, monitoring and evaluation, and communication and dissemination and its impact. 

This meeting was an important opportunity to assess project progress from its beginning to month 18, a milestone which calls for review of current activities, and planning for future actions and strategies in order to shape the next stage of the project in the most effective way possible.

Additionally, Smarter Together project members were able to participate in the events surrounding the culmination of two projects in which Lyon has been involved – Lyon Smart Community, a project which created a Japanese-French partnership in the areas of positive energy buildings, a visualization tool for citizens’ individual data consumption, and a prototype data platform for the Lyon-Confluence area. The second project, FP7-Next Buildings, helped bring about the first mix-use positive energy plot in Lyon-Confluence. The day of 19th October consisted of workshops and study tours in order to learn from the successes of these two projects and share project experiences with the common thread of not only Lyon confluence, but focuses on topics such as data and energy performance.
