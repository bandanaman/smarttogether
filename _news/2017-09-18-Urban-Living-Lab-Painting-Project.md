This autumn will be decidedly more colourful at the Smarter Together urban city lab – thanks to a free exhibition and painting project in which, every Thursday, locals are invited to get involved and swing their brushes. There are times when ‘Smarter Together’ is also about ‘being more creative together!’

Artist, musician and art educationalist Daniel Eichin will be on hand to inspire participants and make sure everyone has a whole lot of fun. The project ‘Explosion of Colour’ began in November 2012 and has since been staged – very successfully – at various venues in Munich. In the Smarter Together district, anyone who wants to can now get together to create large-format works of art and see their own work become part of the neighbourhood lab exhibition. Entrance is free of charge.
