At Munich's Urban Living Lab, a creative review of 2017 was followed by an exciting look ahead to all that Smarter Together has in store for 2018. The lab will stay at its existing premises until the end of the year before “version 2” is opened in the new year within the project area at Limesstrasse 111. On 14 December, local residents were invited to a party as the lab said goodbye to its old home.

**Outlook: Smart City Innovations 2018**
Munich's municipal urban renewal company MGS, which operates the Urban Living Lab, teamed up with Interaktiv, the Munich media competence network, and artist Daniel Eichin to stage a series of exhibitions and presentations. Smarter Together Munich project manager Bernhard Klassen from the City of Munich provided an exciting sneak preview exploring the “Smart City of the Future.” He also outlined the activities planned for the district in 2018 – from the launch of the first mobility stations to upgrades to the smart lamp posts to the release of the SmartCity app, which will combine many related services.

**Interactive art and media in the Urban Living Lab**
Two interactive art and media projects for children, young people and adults were held in the project area in autumn 2017. In the morning on December 14, a work exhibition of the art project “Munich Paintwork – Explosion of Colour” was hosted. Canvasses and paints, tablets and apps were all used to forge links between digital and analogue art. In the evening, the Munich media competence network's “Interactive Room” then organized a closing presentation, displaying all the media competence and urban development projects realized on its premises.
