**Smarter Together is having great success with its mobility projects! The largest and most innovative Viennese urban renewal initiative under the auspices of the Viennese Housing Department, the Viennese part of the EU-funded Horizon 2020/SCC1 project, ‘Smarter Together’ received the Mobility Award of the Verkehrsclub Österreich (VCÖ) in the category ‘Active Mobility and Public Space’.**

**Within the scope of the annual VCÖ Mobility Award, projects are selected which support a holistic approach and are ecologically compatible, socially just and economically efficient. Barbara Novak, Deputy Chair of the Municipal Council’s Commission for Housing, Housing Construction and Urban Renewal, accepted the prize together with project leader Julia Girardi-Hoog.**

**VCÖ Managing Director Willi Nowak congratulated the project:**

‘This project is characterized by the intelligent combination of various means of transport and a strong network character. This is precisely the key that opens the door to climate-compatible mobility with a future’.

**Barbara NOVAK, member of the Municipal Council and regional parliament, said about the award: ‘Wonderful recognition for sustainable urban policy’.**

“The VCÖ Mobility Award for Smarter Together is a wonderful recognition of social and sustainable urban policy. Alone through the mobility projects of Smarter Together there will be a saving of about 45 tons CO2 per year and there will be invested more than two million Euro in the district”, underlined Barbara Novak, member of the Municipal Council who also thanked all project participants.

**45 tons CO2 savings per year in the field of mobility**

With a total of 5 implementation projects and several accompanying activities in the field of mobility alone, Smarter Together is developing new solutions in terms of climate-friendly mobility. Smarter Together is an urban renewal initiative in Simmering under the auspices of Executive Councillor for Housing Michael Ludwig, in which the themes of housing, energy supply, infrastructure and mobility are integrated. Project implementation is characterized by the district focus with respect to people.

It is impressive how, in Smarter Together, the numerous project partners - from municipal departments to different administrative groups to SMEs (‘Sycube’, ‘wohnbund: consult’, ‘Caruso’), and large players (‘Wiener Stadtwerke’, ‘Siemens’, ‘Österreichische Post AG’, the housing association ‘BWSG’) and the research institute AIT worked together on the implementation of the project. The contributions of the Urban Renewal Office ‘GB * 3/11’ and community college ‘VHS Simmering’ show how important the long term experiences of the City of Vienna in activating citizens are.

**Manifold cooperation by Siemens, Post, Wiener Stadtwerk, Sycube, BWSG, GB * 3/11 and AIT**

Through a multitude of collaborations as well as interdisciplinary development work –in the sense of SmartCity programs – new approaches are being tried out. For example, Siemens Austria and the Austrian Post aim at achieving a CO2-free urban logistics. Since January 2017, the Austrian Post has been using E-Vans for parcel delivery. At the Siemens site ‘Leberstraße’ in Simmering, e-vehicles and e-forklifts reduce CO2 and noise emissions. Siemens also supports e-mobility in the private sphere by installing charging stations for e-bikes.

On an individual level too, people can contribute to the environment and switch to alternative forms of mobility. In an apartment building of the BWSG housing association with 485 flats, three e-cars will be available to the residents as part of an e-car-sharing model from autumn 2017 onwards. The Vienna municipality has its first public Mobility Point, which combines different mobility options, such as bike and car-sharing or e-charging stations at a location with links to public transport. An ebike rental by Sycube allows for environmentally friendly mobility on 2 wheels. In addition, the Urban renewal office ‘GB* 3/11’ rents an e-freight-bike for the district.

In addition, a mobility strategy for the district has been developed that takes into consideration all transport modes. In 2016, a mobility survey was conducted together with the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT) with 241 participants. This gave evidence that even in a district with a welldeveloped public transport there are still many cars and/or second cars per household. However, some 40% of households do not have a car and 76% already have a public transport pass. There is also an interest to use bicycles more often. Thus, there is potential for the development of environmentally friendly mobility. At the same time, the project area of central Simmering is an example for many other districts in Vienna.

**Urban Renewal Office GB * 3/11 and Communication for a Real Partnership**

An important information tool of the project is the so called ‘SIMmobil3’, a mobile urban living lab, where people are continuously informed about the latest project developments and mobility offers. It is run by the Urban Renewal Office ‘GB* 3/11’ as a service to Smarter Together. Numerous events also motivate people to participate: test drives with various e-vehicles, bike service, active mobility to school, ‘Beat the Street’, mobility information events and many more.

The mobility projects alone save some 45 tons of CO2 per year and triggered investments of more than 2 million euros in the district. In the end, about 30 electric vehicles will be deployed in the district as well as 40 charging points for electric vehicles. Project Manager Julia Girardi-Hoog: ‘We are delighted to receive the award from the VCÖ and take this as a motivation for the project implementation in the coming years’.
