On 2-3 May 2017, the Smart City Days 2017 and the Smart City Vienna Forum were organized jointly by the [Austrian Climate and Energy Fund](http://www.smartcities.at/service/veranstaltungen/smart-cities-days-2017-and-smart-city-forum/){:target="_blank"}, the Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology as well by the [TINA Vienna](http://www.tinavienna.at/de/news/smart-cities-days-smart-city-wien-forum){:target="_blank"}, the Smart City Agency of the City of Vienna. Representatives from business, research, city governance as well as citizens shared concrete Smart City best practice projects with international partners. Short films, paper presentations, and interactive forums fostered learning and transition processes. Excursions to three sites completed the programs, amongst which were Smarter Together project areas. During the conference, Julia Girardi Hoog, the Vienna Project Leader, presented the Vienna Smarter Together animated film to the larger public.
Particularly focusing in on the excursion to Simmering, some 50 participants in two groups discovered the project's drive for innovation and integration. The groups visited the concrete demonstration sites, the SIMmobile, as well as the innovative ULL (Urban Living Lab), learning about its overall inclusion in the city's Smart City Framework Strategy and respective policy.
