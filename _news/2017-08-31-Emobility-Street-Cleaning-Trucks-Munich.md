<h2><span class="ornament-news">to be Used for Oktoberfest and Beyond</span></h2>
</div>

The City of Munich's Department of Construction has introduced two new electrically powered street cleaning vehicles. The two utility vehicles will be used to empty waste bins in and around the city-center pedestrian zone. They will also be deployed at special events such as Oktoberfest.

Being electric and measuring only 3.3 meters long by 1.1 meter wide, these compact vehicles are also very quiet. In the interests of pedestrian safety, an acoustic signal plays when the vehicles are in motion. Compared to vehicles with conventional drive trains, the new street cleaners save about 1 ton of CO2 emissions per year, per vehicle.
