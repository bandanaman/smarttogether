From 10 October to 21 November 2017, 10 schools with over 4,000 pupils in Vienna’s Simmering district will participate in an innovative and fun mobility game: The Beat the Street in Simmering.

The project originates from Great Britain and is being implemented in Vienna through cooperation between the [Vienna Mobility Agency](https://www.wienzufuss.at/2017/09/28/beat-the-street-wir-gehen-gemeinsam/){:target="_blank"}, the school board [‘Stadtschulrat Wien’,](https://www.stadtschulrat.at/){:target="_blank"} the Smarter Together project as well as [Face Diabetes,](http://www.facediabetes.at/){:target="_blank"} [Intelligent Health](http://www.intelligenthealth.co.uk/){:target="_blank"} and the [Dopplinger und Dopplinger agency.](http://www.ddbvb.at/){:target="_blank"}

Fifty boxes are located throughout the Simmering district, so that participants of all ages can pass by them and register with the use of electronic chips. The chips keep track of movements and makes participants eligible to earn points and prizes, challenging citizens to be active and discover the district. School classes as well as entire schools can form groups, also friends, parents and grandparents can help children obtain points helping their teams to victory. Additionally, clubs, companies, youth - or senior groups can join in on the fun, as well as adults from enterprises or NGOs. The more Beat the Street points one gets (by ticking two or more boxes with even more points), the better. At the end, winners will be rewarded!
