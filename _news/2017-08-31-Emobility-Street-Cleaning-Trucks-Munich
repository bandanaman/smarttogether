<h2><span class="ornament-news">Munich's New E-Street Cleaning Vehicles</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ornament-news">to be Used for Oktoberfest and Beyond</span></h2>
</div>

The City of Munich's Department of Construction has introduced two new electrically powered street cleaning vehicles. These two utility vehicles will be used to empty waste bins in and around the city-center pedestrian zone. They will also be deployed at special events such as the cityâ€™s Oktoberfest.

By being electric and measuring only 3.3 meters long by 1.1 meter wide, these compact vehicles are also very quiet. In the interests of pedestrian safety, an acoustic signal will therefore sound when they are in motion. Compared to vehicles with conventional drive trains, each of the two new street cleaners will save about 1 ton of CO2 emissions per year.
