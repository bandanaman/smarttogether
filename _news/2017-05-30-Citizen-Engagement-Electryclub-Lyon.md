A club of users has been created to first test an application ‘ElectrYc’ made by [Enedis](http://www.enedis.fr/){:target="_blank"}, allowing users to see in real time the electric consumption and production of the neighbourhood. Activities are organised on a monthly basis to involve these inhabitants in better managing their energy consumption are planned in the coming months: visit of energy infrastructure, games, and exchanges. 

The Lyon Local Energy Agency, the SPL Lyon Confluence and the Lyon Metropolis are also involved in the program.
