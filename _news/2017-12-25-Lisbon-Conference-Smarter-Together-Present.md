On 29 November, Smarter Together was represented by [Energy Cities](http://www.energy-cities.eu/){:target="_blank"} in the political panel on the "Smart Cities - Cities of the Future" conference, held in Lisbon and organised by Lisboa E-Nova, the city's Energy and Environment Agency. Francisco Gon√ßalves of Energy Cities, Smarter Together's replication lead, made a presentation about the role that cities play in the energy transition process. 

One of the good examples illustrated by his presentation was the measures being implemented in Viena as part of the Smarter Together project. In this specific case, he highlighted the building retrofit in Simmering, which will have PV panels, and the potential connection with the local condominium eCar-sharing of those housing blocks. In his panel was the Lisbon Deputy Mayor for Energy and Environment. More than 100 participants were in attendance of this 2-day event, including municipalities, SMEs, startups, utilities, universities, and citizens.
