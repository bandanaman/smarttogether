From 14-16 November, the Smarter Together project joined more than 600 exhibitors, 17,000 visitors, and 400 experts and thought leaders from across the globe to contribute to the fostering of smart city innovation, empowerment, digital transformation, and global impact on both the local and national levels. From industry to research to the public sector, Smarter Together along with fellow EU Commission-funded smart cities projects and partners, discussed the future of smart cities and the contributions that the Horizon 2020-funded projects are making in this field across Europe.

Smarter Together project partners were able to share their expertise and specialization in the development of smart city solutions as part of the European Commission’s EU Smart Cities stand, which organized several panel discussion sessions to share ideas and progress across a variety of project areas. On 14 November, Hans Martin Neumann from Smarter Together partner AIT participated in the session titled “measuring smart cities performance.” That same day, Wolfgang Glock from Lighthouse city Munich as well as Gerald Stöckl from Upstream Mobility in Lighthouse city Vienna participated in a session on data management, city data strategy, and urban sharing platforms. Further, Philippe Fournand moderated a session on early identification of potentials for replication, which is a theme shared across all Lighthouse projects.

Further on the shared stand, on 15 November Veronika Cerna from partner GOPA Com. moderated a session on citizen engagement, in which Bojan Schnabl from Lighthouse city Vienna contributed his ideas from a city perspective. Bruno Gaiddon from Smarter partner organization Hespul continued the conversation, focusing on the question, “how smart can energy efficient building renovations be?”

In addition, there were several Smarter Together members who participated within the framework of the main conference program in thematic sessions across the three days of the conference. Karin Markvica from Smarter Together partner AIT gave a presentation on the topic of “co-production in action: towards more equitable cities,” Bojan Schnabl touched upon the subject of affordable housing and sustainable living in his presentation on the 15th, while Wolfgang Glock contributed to the round table conversation on leveraging the power of open data to improve city services. 

Through participation in a wide range of presentations and sessions, Smarter Together was able to contribute to the conversation and showcase the depth of experience encompassed in the project, thus joining the diverse representation of stakeholders at the Smart City Expo World Congress, to collaborate in ensuring future impact in the areas of smart city innovation and transformation.

Smarter Together, participating with over 20 project partners in attendance, is a project funded by the H2020 programme of the European Union that focuses on five concrete areas of co-created and integrated smart solutions in cities: citizen engagement, district heating and renewable energy, holistic refurbishment, smart data, and e-mobility. In a project structure that encourages the replication of solutions, the European lighthouse cities Vienna, Munich and Lyon, the follower cities Santiago de Compostela, Sofia and Venice, come together to improve citizens’ quality of life.
