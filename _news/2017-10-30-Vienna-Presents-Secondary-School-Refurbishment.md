On 29 September 2017, Smarter Together Vienna presented one of its key integrated lighthouse projects: the refurbishment of two linked secondary schools ‘NMS Enkplatz I and II’ in Simmering.

Starting from the initial idea of activating students as ambassadors of the smart city, all actors within the city administration and the political level joined forces developing an integrated vision of the Smart City model school of the future. The current situation led to the conclusion that two old gyms need to be replaced, and additional classrooms are needed. Based on a preparatory study which elaborated on an EU-wide architectural call which opened mid-2017, 37 teams from five EU member states participated with a variety of ideas and solutions. Eight proposals received special mention, and one, by [Burtscher-Durig](http://www.burtscherdurig.at/){:target="_blank"}  architects, CLEARLY won the bid with the most attractive solution. Four full standard gyms will be built underground, with 13 classrooms above, ensuring that thousands of future students have access to plenty of real open space as well - 3.500 m2 for sports and leisure.

The construction work will start in early 2018, although initial on-site research of the underground has already started with all work to be completed in spring 2019. Numerous Smart City subjects will be covered; such as refurbishment, energy management, use of local energy resources, photovoltaics, solar heat, energy reuse, geothermal installations, and infrastructure needs. As a special feature of this project, participation and integration are also tackled in a holistic approach. Solar benches will serve as landmarks and future social meeting points.

The City of Vienna is investing about €30 million, while the share of the Smarter Together project amounts to approximately €457,000. This indicates the high value of EU-H2020 projects, which lead to helping local dynamics in terms of additional investments and innovations.
