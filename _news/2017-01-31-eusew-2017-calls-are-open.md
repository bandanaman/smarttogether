The call has been launched for sessions for the 12th edition of the [EU Sustainable Energy Week Policy Conference (EUSEW 2017)](http://www.eusew.eu/about-conference), to be held in Brussels from 20 to 22 June. Organisers are looking for outstanding proposals for dynamic sessions that inspire new ways to promote energy efficiency and renewables. This year’s theme is Clean Energy for All Europeans, inspired by the European Commission’s [package of proposals](http://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/news/commission-proposes-new-rules-consumer-centred-clean-energy-transition){:target="_blank"} to put consumers and growth at the heart of the sustainable energy transition.

Nominations are also open for the [EU Sustainable Energy Awards](http://www.eusew.eu/about-awards-competition){:target="_blank"}, a highlight of the Policy Conference. These awards recognise outstanding innovations that promote clean, secure and efficient energy as part of the Energy Union. Winners will be announced at a prestigious ceremony at EUSEW 2017.

Guidelines and application forms are on the EUSEW website. Both calls end on 3 March 2017.

If you want to make a more local impact, set up [an Energy Day](http://www.eusew.eu/about-energy-days){:target="_blank"} – events that engage citizens and energy stakeholders in building and strengthening the Energy Union. Registrations are now open to put your event on the Energy Days map on the EUSEW website, where you can find some tips to make your event a success!

Launched in 2006 by the European Commission, EUSEW is organised by the Executive Agency for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (EASME) in close cooperation with Directorate-General for Energy. It brings together public authorities, private companies, NGOs and consumers to promote initiatives to save energy and move towards renewables for clean, secure and efficient power.
