The implementation phase of the Smarter Together project is underway, and it’s time to benefit from the lessons learnt so far!

The six Smarter Together cities (Munich, Vienna, Lyon, Santiago de Compostela, Sofia and Venice) will get together between the 17-19 January in Munich for a peer-to-peer visit and workshops to exchange about their experience and lessons learnt so far (with the key people who are in fact implementing the different measures).

Those cities are now in projects and your city’s experience can also be extremely valuable if you would like to implement similar solutions. Come and challenge them with your ideas and give feedback to them on what they should include into their replication guide!
There are 3 seats available (one person per city). Unfortunately we can’t have everyone! See the draft agenda attached.

Please submit your application to [Francisco Gonçalves](mailto:francisco.goncalves@energy-cities.eu){:target="_blank"} and his colleagues [Kinga](mailto:kinga.kovacs@energy-cities.eu){:target="_blank"} and [Stéphane](mailto:stephane.dupas@energy-cities.eu){:target="_blank"} in copy.

The selection criteria to attend this event:
- You select the areas where your city would like to share experience
- You explain in relation to that area what you are doing in your city and which issues you would like to focus on
- You commit to pay for your travel or accommodation (if it is necessary)

Please submit your application by 5 January 2018. If there are many applicants we will take the ones who demonstrate their interest and are viable candidates on a first come first served basis.
